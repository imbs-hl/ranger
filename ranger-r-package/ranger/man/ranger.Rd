\description{
Ranger is a fast implementation of Random Forest (Breiman 2001) or recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data.
Classification, regression, and survival forests are supported.
Classification and regression forests are implemented as in the original Random Forest (Breiman 2001), survival forests as in Random Survival Forests (Ishwaran et al. 2008).
}
\details{
The tree type is determined by the type of the dependent variable.
For factors classification trees are grown, for numeric values regression trees and for survival objects survival trees.
The Gini index is used as splitting rule for classification.
For regression, the estimated response variances or maximally selected rank statistics (Wright et al. 2016) can be used.
For Survival the log-rank test, a C-index based splitting rule (Schmid et al. 2015) and maximally selected rank statistics (Wright et al. 2016) are available.

With the \code{probability} option and factor dependent variable a probability forest is grown.
Here, the node impurity is used for splitting, as in classification forests.
Predictions are class probabilities for each sample.
In contrast to other implementations, each tree returns a probability estimate and these estimates are averaged for the forest probability estimate.
For details see Malley et al. (2012).

Note that for classification and regression nodes with size smaller than min.node.size can occur, like in original Random Forest.
For survival all nodes contain at least min.node.size samples. 
Variables selected with \code{always.split.variables} are tried additionaly to the mtry variables randomly selected.
In \code{split.select.weights} variables weighted with 0 are never selected and variables with 1 are always selected. 
Weights do not need to sum up to 1, they will be normalized later. 
The usage of \code{split.select.weights} can increase the computation times for large forests.

Unordered factor covariates can be handled in 3 different ways by using \code{respect.unordered.factors}: 
For 'ignore' all factors are regarded ordered, for 'partition' all possible 2-partitions are considered for splitting. 
For 'order' and 2-class classification the factor levels are ordered by their proportion falling in the second class, for regression by their mean response, as described in Hastie et al. (2009), chapter 9.2.4.
For multiclass classification and survival outcomes, 'order' is experimental and should be used with care.
The use of 'order' is recommended for 2-class classification and regression, as it computationally fast and can handle an unlimited number of factor levels. 
Note that the factors are only reordered once and not again in each split.

For a large number of variables and data frame as input data the formula interface can be slow or impossible to use.
Alternatively dependent.variable.name (and status.variable.name for survival) can be used.
Consider setting \code{save.memory = TRUE} if you encounter memory problems for very large datasets.

For GWAS data consider combining \code{ranger} with the \code{GenABEL} package. 
See the Examples section below for a demonstration using \code{Plink} data.
All SNPs in the \code{GenABEL} object will be used for splitting. 
To use only the SNPs without sex or other covariates from the phenotype file, use \code{0} on the right hand side of the formula. 
Note that missing values are treated as an extra category while splitting.

See \url{https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger} for the development version.

To use multithreading on Microsoft Windows platforms, there are currently two options:
\itemize{
 \item Use R-devel with the new toolchain
 \item Install a binary version of ranger, download: \url{https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger/releases}
}
}
\examples{
require(ranger)

## Classification forest with default settings
ranger(Species ~ ., data = iris)

## Prediction
train.idx <- sample(nrow(iris), 2/3 * nrow(iris))
iris.train <- iris[train.idx, ]
iris.test <- iris[-train.idx, ]
rg.iris <- ranger(Species ~ ., data = iris.train, write.forest = TRUE)
pred.iris <- predict(rg.iris, dat = iris.test)
table(iris.test$Species, pred.iris$predictions)

## Variable importance
rg.iris <- ranger(Species ~ ., data = iris, importance = "impurity")
rg.iris$variable.importance

## Survival forest
require(survival)
rg.veteran <- ranger(Surv(time, status) ~ ., data = veteran)
plot(rg.veteran$unique.death.times, rg.veteran$survival[1,])

## Alternative interface
ranger(dependent.variable.name = "Species", data = iris)

\dontrun{
## Use GenABEL interface to read Plink data into R and grow a classification forest
## The ped and map files are not included
library(GenABEL)
convert.snp.ped("data.ped", "data.map", "data.raw")
dat.gwaa <- load.gwaa.data("data.pheno", "data.raw")
phdata(dat.gwaa)$trait <- factor(phdata(dat.gwaa)$trait)
ranger(trait ~ ., data = dat.gwaa)
