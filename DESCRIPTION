Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
          dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
          probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide association
          studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data frames, datasets of
          class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL') and 'dgCMatrix' (R package 'Matrix') 
          can be directly analyzed.
